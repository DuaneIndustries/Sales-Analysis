# Rival Bros Coffee 2020 Item Sales Analysis
For this project I reviewed the Square Sales data for Rival Bros Coffee to compare overall sales performance of items.  
###<b>Data Cleaning:</b> This Data contains items sold on our online square pick up store as well as our cafe, which were recorded as different items.  Additionally, we added new sizing and options mid year, which created new categories for certain items.  As a result, these items were split and needed to be combined. Duplicate items also ended up as uncategorized as a result of adding the online pick up store, and needed to be recombined to reflect accurate sales numbers.  
###<b>Data Visualization : </b>  This project contains a breakdown of our top ten items by both units sold and gross sales, Bar charts of our retail coffee sales( both blends and single origins), and a comparison of our new 16oz sizing alongside the original 12oz and iced options.

# August Tip Report

For this project I analyzed a month of Cafe Transactions to decide whether or not it would be benficial to add a preset 15% gratuity to our online sales.  We had shifted a significant amount of our business online at this point as a result of COVID restrictions, and wanted to make sure this shift didn't disproportionally affect our tipped employees.  As a result of this analysis, we incorporated a 15% gratuity preset for our online sales which improved the consistency in our overall gratuity.
